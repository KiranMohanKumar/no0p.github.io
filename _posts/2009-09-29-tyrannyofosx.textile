*1.  My Ibook Charger, My Poverty*

Steve Jobs you *scoundrel*! $100 for a new battery cable, is that right?!  When my ibook charger started emitting sparks I was horrified -- do you have any idea what the consequences for such faulty engineering are?

Did you pay more than a dollar to manufacture and design that cable -- I think not.  My mind reels at the extortion.  To make matters worse when I inquired about a backup disc for the version of OS X which shipped with my ibook, I was met with another $100.00 charge.  Considering I already owned a license that is some expensive plastic!

<br/>*2.  Labor Exploitation*

A cursory search of Apple's third world labor exploitation revealed startling and seriously grim information.  "According to various Chinese media reports, the worker at Chinese manufacturer Foxconn committed suicide last week after a fourth-generation iPhone prototype for which he was responsible went missing."  <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10291701-37.html">Apple Worker Commits Suicide</a>.  I'm sure most hardware manufacturing operations are based on human exploitation but they at least have a smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value">surplus value</a> problem.

<br/>*3.  Status symbols are out of fashion*

This is simple enough.  With a free, open source, hardware independent, stable, fast alternative like linux, when you choose to spend a thousand dollars on an ibook you essentially declare to the world that you have disposable income you choose to *waste*.  Stop.  Let's face it, apple ownership is bourgeois.
