*1.  My New Ibook Charger Shtick*

Steve Jobs you *scoundrel*! $100 for a new battery cable, is that right?!  When my ibook charger started emitting sparks I was horrified -- do you have any idea what the consequences for such faulty engineering are?

Did you pay more than a dollar to manufacture and design that cable -- I think not.  My mind reels at the extortion.  To make matters worse when I inquired about a backup disc for the version of OS X which shipped with my ibook, I was met with another $100.00 charge.  Considering I already owned a license that is some expensive plastic!

<br/>*2. Questionable  Labor Relations*

A cursory search on Apple's manufacturing process led to a grim news story.  "According to various Chinese media reports, the worker at Chinese manufacturer Foxconn committed suicide last week after a fourth-generation iPhone prototype for which he was responsible went missing."  <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10291701-37.html">Apple Worker Commits Suicide</a>.  I'm sure most hardware manufacturing operations are based in third world countries with terrible labor practices but this story makes the problem tough to ignore.

<br/>*3.  Status symbols are out of fashion*

This is simple enough.  With a free, open source, hardware independent, stable, fast alternative like linux, when you choose to spend a thousand dollars on an ibook you essentially declare to the world that you have disposable income you choose to *waste*.   It's a little booghie.
