There is something about nice output that makes you feel good inside.  Like the guarantee written on the outside of a box, a green characters are reassuring.  I rather like Test::Unit as well.  It has a certain moral rigidity to it, not entirely dissimilar to Batman's.  When I use rspec I feel like the kid who always had to change his controller settings before his turn to play Mortal Kombat.  So ... to spice up the Test::Unit output there are some solutions in the world today.    

* 1. The gems *

There is a great turn gem -- Test::Unit Reporter (New).  As the readme notes, if you also install the facets gem turn will produce colored output. 

{%highlight ruby%}
  sudo gem install facets
	sudo gem install turn
{%endhighlight%}

* 2. Add a quick require to your test/test_helper.rb  *
Since we're running rails tests you want to add the folowing line to test/test_helper.rb to require turn.

{%highlight ruby%}
begin; require 'turn'; rescue LoadError; end
{%endhighlight%}

* 3. Tweaking the output *

While turn is great by default I kind of like a little more color to help distinguish meaning quickly.  For example you can dig into the gem and add a line to TestRunner.t_test_started in /lib/turn.rb:

{%highlight ruby%}
	file = COLORIZE ? ::ANSICode.yellow(file) : file	
{%endhighlight%}
