I found the lightweight, no distractions window manager I've been looking for today: windowlab.

Here is a picture of me writing this blog post in window lab.

h3. How to install

@apt-get install windowlab@

or check out the source at <a href="http://nickgravgaard.com/windowlab/">http://nickgravgaard.com/windowlab/</a>

h3. Usage tips

Any elite window manager should be completely unusable unless you've read at least a page of documenttion.  Fortunately this is the case with window lab which will greet you with a completely blank and unresponsive screen when you first start it.

Top N usage tips:

1. Hold right click to display the control on the top of the screen.
2. F11 Full Screen Window
3. Alt drag to resize windows
4. Double click window handles to change Z value of window
5. When active applications in menu, hold down left click and swipe over menu.

Turns out there is not a lot to this window manager.

h3. Configuration Tips

First we need to hijack the config that will launch our x session and call our own script.  This involves changing the Exec key in the file @/usr/share/xsessions/windowlab.desktop@ for a relatively current ubuntu system.

bc. [Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=WindowLab
Comment=This session logs you into WindowLab
Exec=/usr/bin/windowlab_start
Icon=
Type=Application

The following are the contents of @/usr/bin/windowlab_start@

bc. #!/bin/bash
nitrogen --restore &
conky -b &
gnome-terminal &
/usr/bin/windowlab

Check the docs on nitrogen and conky for configuring those items.

Well that's it.  I encourage you to try a cool new window manager like windowlab.
