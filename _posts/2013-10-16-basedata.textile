Sometimes you need some 'testing' data for exploring concepts and technology.  And if you happen to be working with a relational database, sometimes it is nice to have this data in the form ddl and dml SQL statements.

The R statistical environment has an excellent built in data() function which returns a bunch of experimental data tied to libraries and documentation examples.  I wrote a short script as a personal exercise in procedural R coding to generate the SQL from the R data() sets.  It is available below.
